# javascriptChallenge

In my javascriptChallenge repository, you'll find the "index.html" file within the "UFO_level_1 folder.  That's what you'll need to open up so that you view the UFO website.  Also within the repository, in the "js" folder, you'll find the "app.js" and "data.js" files that contain the structure and data for the UFO website.

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that allows users to filter UFO sighting data based on a date.  I used the starter code html as the basic layout for the website, only change I made to the html code was adding the reference to D3js on line eleven.  From there, first order of business was to console log the UFO data so I could see what I was working with.  The data is in the form of a JavaScript object, so i knew immediately that it was just a matter of linking the user input with the correct/corresponding key,value pair.

first block of code in the app.js file is to just get all the UFO data into the webpage.  I'm taking the dataset of UFO info that was provided, embedding it into the table body of the HTML, so that it will add rows for each, individuial UFO sighting.  After that, it's just a matter of linking up the date that the user inputs into the box with the correct row of data in the UFO dataset.  Once the user input is matched with the corresponding value from the dataset, I'm filtering the dataset based on that date.  Pretty straightforward.

Please note that I did start the optional/bonus portion of this assignment and there is a "UFO_level_2".  I made the necessary updates to the "index.html" file and started on the javaScript revisions and just ran out of time.  So you might just take a quick look at that, it's not completed but I did start it.

thanks for reading, please contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
